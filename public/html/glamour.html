                Glamour was born in <span title="She is only 5 years old!">2017,</span> and has always wanted perfection more than anything else.
                <br>
                Despite her young age, she is one of the older Beanie Boo types, being bred in 2013!
                <br>
                Like most Beanie Boos, her favourite colour is her main colour on her body.
