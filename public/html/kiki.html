                Her energy, her sense of fashion, and her kindness make her the perfect leader for the Cat Club!
                <br />
                She came up with the idea, and it turned out to be a good one.

                1. Her parents HATE bows, which makes it even stranger that she loves them.
                <br />
                2. Her mother is a Squish-A-Boo. Scientists <i>still</i> don't know why Squish-A-Boos can make Beanie Boos!

            1. Tabitha is the only cat in her family that isn't gray! Her bow and eye colours are also different!
            <br>
            2. Their teeth are much smaller than the average 3 year old cat...
