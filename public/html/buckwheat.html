                Buckwheat was born in <span title="He is 7.5 years old">2014!</span> He is the oldest student in his class!
                <br>
                He is also the only Lynx in his entire school, and the only Beanie Boo Lynx!
                <br>
                I guess you could say he's pretty unique.

                1. He's the only student in his class with long hair on their ears!
                <br />
                2. He has one of the most detailed noses in the Beanie Boo world.
