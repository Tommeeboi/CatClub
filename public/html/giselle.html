                In <span title="She is 8 years old">2013</span>, Giselle was born! But she didn't look the same as she does now.
                <br>
                She used to look like her sister <span title="Another member :)">Livvy</span>, but all of the pink parts were purple.
                <br>
                One day, she was asked to take pictures of a science experiment. She was bitten by a radioactive animal and... yeah.

                1. She's the only one with a horn in her family!
                <br />
                2. She's the only kid in her family who has fully grown spots!
