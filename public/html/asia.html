                Asia was born in <span title="She is 6 years old, almost 7!">2016</span>, on June 6!
                <br>
                She is the brother of <span title="Another member of the Cat Club">Tiggy</span>, and equally as silly as him!
                <br>
                Her parents named her Asia, even though she's a European Exclusive Beanie Boo. I know, strange.
                <br>
                <br>

                <div class="funHeader">Fun Facts:</div>
                1. She has solid nose, but Tiggy has a fuzzy nose. Very strange, considering they're from the same family.
                <br />
                2. She's a white tiger, but her brother is a brown tiger.
                <br />
                3. She sat on an <span title="IT'S JUST A PHARMACY, CALM DOWN">adoption stand</span> for half a year.
