                Juniplush was born in <span title="She is only 5 years old!">2017,</span> as a character from the popular game known as Geometry Dash!
                <br>
                Her birthday is April 2, 2017, SO CLOSE to April Fools! Luckily, she just missed it.
                <br>
                Her favourite colour is green, if you couldn't tell already.
                <br>

                1. Block cats sleep sideways, which explains the picture in a nutshell.
                <br />
                2. She has three stripes on her head instead of two, which makes her EVEN more rare!
                <br />
                3. She's one of the <i>best</i> Geometry Dash players in the WORLD!
                <br>
                4. She is the youngest student in her class.
                <br>
                5. She has the same birthday as <span title="Another member of the Cat Club">Reagan</span>!
