                In <span title="She is 7 years old">2014</span>, Mai came to the world! She has detail on her nose, which is quite rare these days.
                <br>
                Her birthday is February 8, 2014. If you try to talk to her, be warned that she takes everything incredibly seriously.
                <br>
                She's one of the coolest looking cat breeds in my opinion, and many others!
                <br>

                <div class="funHeader">Fun Facts:</div>
                1. She's covered in permanent glitter, which is a rare feature.
                <br />
                2. She is the first Valentines Day Beanie Boo that doesn't have a heart! (On the outside)
                <br />
                3. She has the biggest ears in the entire Cat Club!
