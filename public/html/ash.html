                Ash was born in February 19 <span title="She is 7 years old">2015</span>, and has always loved... food. Lots of food.
                <br>
                She likes to eat low quality fast food every day (big mac), and her parents don't even care!
                <br>
                She can be a little crazy sometimes, but she is a nice, funny friend to have.
                <br>

                <div class="funHeader">Fun Facts:</div>
                1. She spent 3 days in a dumpster, but managed to keep her fur clean(ish)!
                <br />
                2. Her mouth and nose are different colours!
                <br />
                3. Her nose has detail on it. This is rare if you somehow didn't know already.
                <br>
                4. Her horn is smaller than average, which is strange because <span title="Her sister, and another member of the Cat Club">Heather's</span> horn is bigger than average.
                <br>
                5. She has stripes on the back of her fur (and it isn't just because of the dumpster.)
