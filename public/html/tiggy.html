                Tiggy was born in <span title="He is 6 years old">2016,</span> and only started growing his stripes 2 years ago!
                <br>
                He still needs to grow a few more, but he's almost there.
                <br>
                His birthday is April 16 2022.

                1. He has the biggest roar in his entire class!
                <br />
                2. He has a green tip of the tail, and green eyes and ears! This is very rare.
                <br />
                3. He is one of the newest Beanie Boos with a fuzzy nose! (He's from 2019)
